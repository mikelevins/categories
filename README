    I. Introduction

---------------
I. INTRODUCTION
---------------

Categories is an experimental object system that provides polymorphic
functions with multiple dispatch, user-defined structured data types,
optional single or multiple inheritance, and programmable
dispatch. The object system is language-neutral, with implementations
provided for R5RS Scheme, Gambit-C Scheme with Gambit-specific
features, and Clojure. There are small differences in the API and
semantics from one language host to another, especially with regard to
the way that assignment to object slots is treated.
